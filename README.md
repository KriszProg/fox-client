<h1>Fox-Client Application </h1>

---
<h3>What does this Application do?</h3>

- this application is designed to act as a `client` within a __microservice__ architecture
- it communicates with other microservices _(currently integrated with one: the `parcel-handler` service)_
- the application can either forward the data received from the `parcel-handler` in its original form or combine data retrieved from different endpoints of `parcel-handler` _(e.g.: via `getParcelWithTrackingEventsByParcelNo()` feature)_
- with future integrations the `client` is able to combine data retrieved from multiple microservices
- it offers a set of [Endpoints](#Endpoints) to retrieve data
- all responses are provided in `JSON` format


<h4>IMPORTANT NOTES: </h4> 
- To ensure proper operation, please download and run the `parcel-handler` microservice from [here](https://github.com/KriszProg/parcel-handler).
- Make sure that `parcel-handler` is running correctly before starting this application.
